	// This file represents all of the config items that we define in our appsettings.json.  You don't NEED to define anything here, but you can if you want
	// Best practice would say that you should NOT put any sensitive security items in here, those should reside in your secrets.json and then later in your ENV variables of your app service or your key vault
	// These are not representative of ALL the config items but just an idea of what can be added.
	// Also note that the structure of this file directly corresponds to the AppConfig.cs file.
